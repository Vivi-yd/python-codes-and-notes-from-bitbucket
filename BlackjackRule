#Blackjack Rule

1. Card Value:
   
   Number cards has the value equal to the numbers.
   Face card (J, Q, K) has the value of 10.
   Aces can be either 1 or 11.
   
2. Gameplay:

   The game is play by a Dealer and a Player.
   
   Game start by dealing 2 cards to both the Dealer and the Players, where the Dealer has one card hidden (hole card).
   After having 2 cards at hands, the Player can decide to "Stand" or "Hit".
   When "Hit" is chosen, the Player is dealt another card. If the Player's hand exceed a value of 21, he is busted.
   If not, the Player can again choose to "Stand" or "Hit".
   If "Stand" is chosen, the Player's round ends, and the Dealer's hole card is revealed and gets to deal cards 
   until it reaches 17 (soft limit) or higher but lower than 21, then the Dealer is force to "Stand" as well.
   If both players did not get busted, then the values of both hands are compared and the one that got closer or equal to 21 win!
   In this Course, if it ends with ties, the Dealer wins.
   
That's it! Hope I did well :)
