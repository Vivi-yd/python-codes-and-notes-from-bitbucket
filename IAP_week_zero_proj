#First 1-line project from "Interactive Python Course" from Coursera. :)

print "We want... a shrubbery!"

#I clicked the edit button on the right hand side. It reloaded and then added this line. This 
#was saved in plain text format
#there is drop-down menu at the bottom. 
# I converted this into python file using that :)

#But I didn't see the edit button previously....I must have missed it...hehe
#Thanks for helping Ashu. :)
