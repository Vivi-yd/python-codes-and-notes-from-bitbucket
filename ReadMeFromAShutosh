I Have added this plain text file to your repository.
You can add and save your codes (like by cut-paste) by going to source tab and selecting new file on the right hand side.
You have to give it a name (without extension). 
You can choose python or other language code from the drop-down menu at the bottom. It is plain text by default.
Once you have written your code, you have to push the commit button. 
Hope this helps :)
